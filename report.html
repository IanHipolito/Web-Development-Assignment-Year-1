        <h2>1. Problem Description</h2>
        <p>I made a five page website not including the contact form or report page about a well known football called
            called Paris Saint Germain or PSG for sort. The five pages include a Home page, an About page, #
            a page that showcases PSG's players on its first team, a page that showcases PSG's achievements throughout
            the years and its
            player's achievements also. All the pages include a responsive and interactive navbar and footer. The footer
            includes links to
            the other pages of my website and also some of PSG's offical websites. The content my website offers is an
            incite to PSG's history and
            how they progressed throughout the years and how they are at present day with the use of videos, images and
            written context. I used a lots of html, css and a good
            bit of javascript to make my website as appealling to the audience to the best of my ablility. With going
            through my website I can guarantee you will know so much about PSG.
            I also showcase the entire first squad with their names and jersey numbers. I really like PSG's kits so I
            made of the merchanise or kits
            to showcase their 2021/2022 kit drops in the case someone wanted to know what they looked like and purchased
            them.<br><br>
            The archetypical users of my website do not have to be major PSG fans or even football fans. It is user
            friendly and easy to understand for everyone. However, the
            majority of my users or people that would view my website would be those who are interested in sports,
            mainly football. Users who know about football may come to my site
            to gain some knowledge about PSG since they are interested or invested in the sport. My user audience would
            also include French people or
            native Parisians who want to know about their countries biggest football club.<br><br>
            When I was researching about PSG's foundation and history, there was not many useful resources out there
            about it. There were a few but that was about it. Most of the pages
            were either very old and did not have much information or were just generally hard to understand. That is
            why I think my website solves that problem as the information is
            fairly easy to take in and is very user friendly unlike most of the websites I went into when tyring to
            research for this topic. It also solves the problem of a lack of condensed
            information on my particular topic.

        <h2>2. Research</h2>
        <p>For my website I got most of my inspiration from the <a href="https://en.psg.fr/">offical PSG website</a>. I
            also used two other websites such as the offical PSG
            <a href="https://store.psg.fr/en/?_s=bm-FI-PSC-PSG-EN-HeaderURL-Desktop">offical PSG online shopping
                website</a> and I used a bit of <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.">wikipedia</a>
            as there was not many other options. I evaluated all three websites to see what I could use to for own
            website
            and looked at all the content the three websites had to offer. I will outline the content and structure I
            used for my own website
            from the other three underneath:
        </p>

        <img class="home" src="Assets/images/home.jpg" alt="Home">
        <img class="home" src="Assets/images/home2.jpg" alt="Home2">
        <p>
            As you can see the two images above, the first being my home page and the second a page on the offical PSG
            website. I really liked the layout
            the PSG had with using an image as a background and adding something on top of the image. I took great
            inspirationin this and made up my own
            version and instead of just one image I used a image carousel or rotator to swap between different images in
            the background. I had to use javascript
            for my home page background which made up one of the 3 elements of javascript I needed. Instead of having
            the PSG crest, I decided to go with text instead.
        </p>

        <img class="box" src="Assets/images/writingunderimg.jpg" alt="Writing1">
        <img class="box" src="Assets/images/writingunderimg2.jpg" alt="Writing2">
        <p>
            I did not really want to use wikipedia as one of my research sources as it does have structure it does not
            have
            the structure or content I want to use on my website as it is basically just all writing and a few images
            here and there.
            However, I did take inspiration in the way wikipedia structured their images with a border and text
            underneath it. As you can see
            in the first image I used the same structure for my images for my achievements page on my website. It was an
            easy way to caption
            to caption an image without have too much hassle with putting the text on top of the image.
        </p>

        <img class="kit" src="Assets/images/shop.jpg" alt="Shop1">
        <img class="kit" src="Assets/images/shop2.jpg" alt="Shop2">
        <p>
            I used PSG's offical online shopping website as I knew I was going to have a page about their new kits. I
            liked the
            way the online shop was layed out with images just on the home page of website. I wanted to do something
            similar with
            my page so I took the idea of having images of the kits going length ways across the website, but I also
            wanted to add some text underneath
            the images. I also put text on top of my images just like how they have "Paris Saint_Germain x Jordan" on
            their website, but
            instead I aligned my text to the middle of my images. I also discovered parallax websites on w3schools so I
            incorporated that into my page
            also.
        </p>

        <img class="PC" src="Assets/images/PC.jpg" alt="Player Card 1">
        <img class="PC" src="Assets/images/PC2.jpg" alt="Player Card 2">
        <p>
            I got a lot of inspiration from the layout of the player cards on PSG's offical website on their first team
            page. On PSG's page
            when you hovered over the player an overlay would pop up and give you all the statistics of that player and
            you could click
            on the player card for more information on that player. Although I really wanted mine to look like that, it
            was too hard for
            me at my skill set at the minute so I decided to go for something a bit easier but similar. I also made my
            own player cards
            and had a transition for each player card so their names, position and jersey numbers would come up. In
            general my team page and PSG's
            team page have a very similar layout and structure.

        <h2>3. Technology Selection and Site Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            For my website i used the latest versions HTML5 and CSS3.
            I made the website mobile friendly. As you compress the website the various text and images shrink and this
            allows for a user friendly experience. I incoporated javascript to allow the nav bar to change into a
            hamburger menu when the page becomes a certain smaller size. Various paragraph text align to the centre and
            font size decrease as you move into mobile use. Size of images alternate as you switch into different
            screens and this allows users to have the same experience throughout different devices. I also used corousel
            slideshow using css and javascript which makes for a more appealing website allowing users to engage more
            with the content.
        </p>

    <section class="JS">
        <h2>4. JavaScript Functionality</h2>
        <p>
            In total I added four pieces of working JavaScript to my website. The first being my navigation bar for each
            of my pages. I made my navigation bar responsive and can be used for people using a mobile device as when
            you
            shrink the page a burger menu will come up and the user will be able to press it to reveal all the other
            pages.
            I also made a carousel slideshow or rotator for my home page. For my carousel slideshow I used a 
            javascript function where I set a timer and the next image appears after
            that timer and so on. When the state is on the last image I made sure to start the loop again making it continuous.
            For my about page I used a short javascript function that allows the user to scroll down the page and the video will
            fade away as you scroll down the page. 
            My achievement page included a image slider that uses a javascript function. The javascript function allows the user
            to use arrows on either side of the slider to switch from the previous or next image. I also included dots which the user can 
            click and each dot corresponds to a specfic image and will always go to that image when clicked.
            I also used javascript to validate three pieces of my contact form. The user cannot enter an invalid email, name or phone
            number and the user will not be able to submit a contact form.

        <h2>5. Low Fidelity Prototype</h2>
        <img class="page" src="Assets/images/Home.png" alt="HomePro">
        <img class="page" src="Assets/images/About.png" alt="AboutPro">
        <img class="page" src="Assets/images/Team.png" alt="TeamPro">
        <img class="page" src="Assets/images/Achievements.png" alt="AchievementsPro">
        <img class="page" src="Assets/images/Merch.png" alt="MerchanisePro">
        <p>
            For the Home page prototype I started by adding a header and a footer as them tow elements
            are very important to my website layout and structure. I also added a navigation bar/ menu to the
            header for easy access to the other pages. For the Home page I also add a rotating background image
            which rotates through some images. I also added text on top of the background image.<br><br>
            For my About page prototype I started the same way I did with the home page prototype by adding a header, a
            footer and a navigation
            bar. I then added a muted video that autoplays when you enter the page and text underneath it. Then I added
            two seperate text containers
            for some text. I added another video under the to text containers in order to fill the page with as much
            information I could think of.<br><br>
            Like always I started my Team prototype page with the header, footer and navigation bar. This is a different
            layout to my other pages
            the Headings will be for the positions players play in and the white boxes on the page are the player cards
            with their names and jersey numbers.
            There is more player cards than what is showcased in the prototype.<br><br>
            Again I started my Achievements prototype page with the header, footer and navigation bar. But instead of a
            single image or video
            I added a image slider instead. Under the image slide I added four text containers. Underneath the text
            containers, I added four image containers
            for a few images of football transfer.<br><br>
            Last but not least for my Merchanise prototype page I again added the same header, footer and navigation bar
            to the page. I added five images down the page with margins and spaces for text inbetween the images.
            I also added headings in the middle of the image for a pleasant and stylish effect to the page.<br><br>
            Prototypes are useful to get a basis of what you want the layout and structure of your page to be!

    <section class="devplan">
        <h2>6. Development Plan</h2>
        <p>
            To start off my website, I will make prototypes and wireframes for each of the pages. This is going to allow
            me to have a general
            idea of my pages will look like after the finished project. Doing this will save time in the future because
            the you are not wasting
            your time thinking of what to add to your website. I will obviously start by outlining my html file and
            creating a header with a navigation
            bar and a footer that I will reuse for every page. I would gather the necessary information for the content
            and text for my website and put
            all together before styling the page with CSS.<br><br>
            After I have the the right layout and structure for my pages I will start using CSS to style my pages and
            make them look more
            appealing to the user. I will also make all the pages reponsive and check for any mistakes in my CSS. I will
            reuse a lot of my CSS styling and html tags
            in my other pages so save a lot of time and to make it more coherent.<br><br>
            After finishing up with all the html and CSS for a page I will start with the javascript for my navigation
            bar and use the function for eah of my pages.
            I will add a few javascript elements to my pages to add another level to my pages and error check them as I
            go.
            After finishing all my pages I will add a contact form to my website with some javascript validation.
        </p>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section class="test">
        <h2>7. Testing Plan</h2>
        <p>
            I will validate both HTML and CSS files. I will use a commercial software package or free online
            application, such as the following World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) validators: W3C CSS Validator at
            http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ or W3C HTML Validator at http://validator.w3.org/.
            If there are any errors I will try my best to fix whatever I can and clean up my code. Once I have validated
            and checked
            for any possible errors in my code, I will cross check my website on various different browsers such as
            google, firefox, microsoft edge,
            internet explorer, etc. This allows me to check if all my code is functioning properly and loading up with
            ease and that nothing is missing
            or a bug occurs. Having a testing plan and testing all your code is very important for a website to be fully
            cooperative.

    <section class="eval">
        <h2>8. Site Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
            Site evaluation is one of the most important things a web developer needs to do when making a website.
            To evaluate my website, I will thoroughly check for any mistakes or errors in my website and in my code.
            Having minimal errors is crucial which makes this part of making and building a website so
            important.<br><br>
            I will continue to go over every page in my website to ensure I am happy with the final product. I will
            analyse
            every last bit of the sites and if I come across any errors no matter how minor I will fix them. I will see
            if my
            website properly showcases what I want it to showcase and if it is overall coherent and easy to navigate, as
            what good
            is a website when it is not easy to use or navigate through.<br><br>
            I will so check if the sites functionalities are working as they are supposed to and if not will make the
            necessary changes in order for the website to function the way I want ot to. Once I am happy with the
            overall
            look, functionality, coherence and balance of the website I know that I have evaluated my website to the
            best of my
            ability.

    <section class="logbooks">
        <h2>9. Weekly Log Books</h2>
        <h3>Week 1:</h3>
        <p>Since Tuesday the 9th of November, when Jonathan Mccarthy (Web Development lecturer) briefly mentioned our
            project assignment about making our own website, I have been thinking about what I am going to do. I have a
            fair idea on what my website is going to be based on. I have two ideas as far. The first being to make my
            website about PSG (Paris Saint Germain). PSG is a European football club and is my favourite team. Another
            idea is to do my project on my hometown in Monaghan called Castleblayney since I am studying in Dublin
            nobody really knows where that is, and I thought it would be cool to have something to show my new friends
            up here in Dublin every time they ask me where Castleblayney is. However, I am going to give myself a few
            days or week to fully finalise my idea for my website as I want it to be an interesting topic. I am going to
            write down every idea that comes to mind and pick which one I will be able to make a great website for and
            will get me the most marks. It is a difficult choice because I do not want to do something that I won't be
            able to write about and this will affect how my website will turn out. I am also going to keep track of my
            work and have a set time schedule of when I am going to work on this project, so I am not behind or late
            submitting it. I am also going to do extensive research on other websites to spark ideas for my own website
            and watch a few videos on JavaScript as I am not very familiar with it along with Jonathan’s help in his
            upcoming lectures.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Week 2:</h3>
        <p>A week has passed, and I have been learning new html, css and javascript techniques to complete my project to
            a good standard. I am 99% sure that I am going to do my website on PSG but may change my mind by the end of
            the week if I can think of a better and more interesting topic for my website. For now, I am going to keep
            researching topics and learning more style.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Week 3:</h3>
        <p>I still have not fully made up my mind on what my website is going to be on. I am stuck between doing a
            personal portfolio on myself or PSG. But I will decide before next Monday because I want to get started on
            the pages for my website. I am still currently learning the basics of JavaScript. </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Week 4:</h3>
        <p>I have decided to do my website on PSG (Paris Saint Germain) as I already have lots of knowledge about the
            football club and it was easier for me to gather content for. I started on the basic templates for my
            websites and will do it bit by bit throughout the upcoming weeks. I have a few ideas for the different pages
            for my website but I still need to think of a few more as I don't not want my website to look plain or
            boring.</p>

        <h3>Week 5:</h3>
        <p>I have started my website on PSG and making very good progress. I have done the basic html layouts for all my
            pages so far and will do the CSS styling as I go with each page. I am still trying to figure out how I will
            use JavaScript but I think I will definitely come up with some ideas during the weekend. Since this is due
            in basically a week, I am going to continue to do it everyday until the due date.</p>
