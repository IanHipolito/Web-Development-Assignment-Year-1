                <h2 class="histhead">History</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    In the summer of 1970, an ambitious group of businessmen decided to create a major team in the
                    French capital.
                    Guy Crescent and Pierre-Étienne Guyot chose to merge their newly formed side, Paris Football Club,
                    with Stade Saint-Germain of Henri Patrelle after the team from Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 15km west of
                    Paris, were promoted to Ligue 2. The three men were stuck with the financial feasibility of the
                    project, however they met with Real Madrid's president Santiago Bernabéu.<br><br>
                    Bernabéu told them that starting a crowdfunding campaign was the best solution to establish a new
                    team.
                    After a petition was signed by 20,000 people, Paris Saint-Germain Football Club were officially
                    formed
                    on 12 August 1970.<br><br>
                    Following a delicate financial situation, the Paris City Council offered to pay the club's debt and
                    in return demanded them to adopt the more Parisian name of "Paris Football Club". After PSG
                    president Henri Patrelle refused the name change and financial support was withdrawn, the club split
                    in 1972. Paris FC remained in the top tier, while PSG were administratively relegated to
                    Division 3.<br><br>
                    After many ups and downs throughout the years with finances and mismanagement,
                    Paris Saint Germain managed to climb up the ranks and divisions and finally made it
                    back into the first divison of Ligue 1 in 1974 and remained there since.

                <h2 class="histhead">Present</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    Paris Saint Germain changed dramatically when Qatar Sports Investments purchased
                    the club in 2011. This not only made Paris Saint Germain the richest club in France
                    but one of the wealthiest clubs in the world. Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi pledged
                    to form a team capable of winning the UEFA Champions League and making the club France's
                    biggest name. However they have yet to claim the UEFA Champions League title.<br><br>
                    From then on the club began to make some of the biggest signings in football history to date.
                    This included Zlatan Ibrahimović, Thiago Silva, Edinson Cavani, David Luiz and
                    many more, who were coached and managed by Carlo Ancelotti,. These signings led the team to great
                    success,
                    winning them a number of trophies throughout the years. Despite the departure of Carlo Ancelotti,
                    PSG kept
                    its winning ways under Laurent Blanc.<br><br>
                    After losing 6-1 to Barcalona in the second leg of the round of sixteen, despite winning the first
                    leg in France
                    by a score of 4-0. PSG signed Neymar Jr. for a world-record fee of €222 million, making him the most
                    expensive player
                    ever and French prodigy Kylian Mbappé on an initial loan, which was made permanent in 2018 in a
                    transfer worth €180 million
                    plus add ons, making him both the second-most expensive player and most expensive teenager. Paris
                    Saint Germain continues to
                    make massive transfers such as signing Achraf Hakimi, Georginio Wijnaldum, Sergio Ramos, Gianluigi
                    Donnarumma and Lionel Messi in
                    just one year (2021). Although having a number if different managers such as Unai Emery, Thomas
                    Tuchel and
                    Mauricio Pochettino they have not yet won a Champions League Trophy.
